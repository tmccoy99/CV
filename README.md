# Thomas McCoy

As a recent coding bootcamp graduate with a strong academic background in mathematics, I am an enthusiastic and habitual problem solver, constantly seeking to apply my skills to real-world challenges. My discovery of programming in my second year of university was a revelation that ignited my passion for technology and drove me to pursue a career in the field. After graduating with experience of numerical computation and simulation in Python, I completed a rigorous, 12-week web development course at Makers Academy, where I gained valuable experience working in agile teams to develop full-stack web applications.  

My time at Makers Academy solidified my passion for the dynamic and rapidly evolving world of software development. As a motivated individual who thrives on learning and growth, I am excited by the prospect of staying current with the latest advancements and leveraging new knowledge to drive innovation and create value. I look forward to applying my skills and experience to real-world challenges and collaborating with like-minded professionals to deliver exceptional results.

My languages and technologies: JavaScript, Ruby, Python, HTML, CSS, React, React Native, Jest, Cypress, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Expo, ActiveRecord, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, RSpec, Pandas, SciPy

## Skills

#### Communication
My master's degree provided extensive research and project experience, which honed my ability to communicate effectively in both written and verbal forms. I am highly proficient in researching academic papers, writing scientific reports using LaTeX, and presenting findings to groups of academics. These experiences have strengthened my communication skills, enabling me to articulate complex ideas with clarity and precision.

My advanced level of comprehension and clear explanations were invaluable during my time at Makers Academy, where I consistently demonstrated the ability to not only grasp new concepts quickly but also to effectively communicate them to my fellow students, aiding in their understanding and development.

#### Problem Solving
My innate problem-solving ability is what led me to pursue a degree in mathematics, where I developed a rigorous and methodological approach to solving complex problems. This mindset enabled me to achieve first-class marks in every formative exam throughout my time at university, demonstrating my exceptional problem-solving skills.

Drawing on this experience, I am able to effectively break down complex programming problems into manageable components and develop structured, object-oriented solutions that align with industry best practices, as is evidenced by the positive feedback I received in an external review of my coding practices (how to share this?). Furthermore, the meticulousness imbued in me by my degrees ensures that I test and accomodate for edge-cases in advance, resulting in code that is high-quality and error-free.

#### Another Skill
- Collaborated as a pivotal member of an agile team, contributing to the successful delivery of three key projects within tight timelines. Demonstrated exceptional listening and communication skills during daily stand-ups and retrospectives, ensuring efficient project progress and seamless team coordination.
- Earned positive external feedback for my proficiency in integrating object-oriented programming (OOP) and test-driven development (TDD) methodologies into my workflow. Adapted quickly to new concepts and skill sets, reflecting a strong aptitude for continuous learning and professional development.
- Excelled in becoming proficient with unfamiliar technologies, including React, ActiveRecord, and Cypress, in a matter of days. Demonstrated an innate ability to thrive beyond my comfort zone and deliver exceptional results under challenging circumstances.
- Consistently leveraged my strong verbal communication skills to maximise the benefits of pair programming, enabling my pairs to solve complex problems and accelerate learning.
- Applied my rigorous mathematical nature to meticulously testing code across multiple frameworks, including Jest, React Native Testing Library, RSpec, and Cypress. Utilized critical thinking and problem-solving skills to ensure comprehensive test coverage and deliver high-quality, error-free code.
Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.
