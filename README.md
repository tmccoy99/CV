# Thomas McCoy

A recent coding bootcamp graduate with a strong academic background, specializing in the backend. My rigorous, methodological approach to problem solving and ability to visualize abstract concepts, honed during my master's education in Mathematics, enabled me to excel as a student at Makers Academy - an intensive, 12-week coding bootcamp known for producing both technically competent and emotionally intelligent developers. During my time at Makers, I transitioned my understanding of numerical computation into the ability to deliver full-stack applications while working as part of an agile team.

As a motivated individual who derives satisfaction from continual learning and growth, I am particularly drawn to the technology industry for its dynamic, ever-evolving nature. I am excited by the prospect of staying abreast of the latest advancements and trends, and leveraging new knowledge to drive innovation and create value.

My languages and technologies: JavaScript, Ruby, Python, HTML, CSS, React, React Native, Jest, Cypress, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Expo, ActiveRecord, Sinatra, PostgreSQL,  RSpec, Pandas, SciPy

## Work Experience

2015 – 2018: Assistant Tennis Coach, Milligan Tennis,
Southdown Sports Club Lewes
- Achieved a Level 1 Coaching Qualification which consisted of
practical and theoretical training and required good time
management skills alongside my A Levels.
- Undertook significant responsibility for planning, coordinating,
and delivering holiday camps for children aged 4 – 13 as well as
term-time coaching squads.
- Developed excellent verbal communication skills and used my
initiative and friendly personality to motivate children to achieve in
a safe and enjoyable environment.
- Became a reliable, committed member of a team of 6 staff,
supporting colleagues by being punctual, collaborative, and
flexible to cover shifts as required.
- Learned how to deal with complaints and pressure situations in a
calm, logical and polite way.

## Skills
- Collaborated as a pivotal member of an agile team, contributing to the successful delivery of three key projects within tight timelines. Demonstrated exceptional listening and communication skills during daily stand-ups and retrospectives, ensuring efficient project progress and seamless team coordination.
- Earned positive external feedback for my proficiency in integrating object-oriented programming (OOP) and test-driven development (TDD) methodologies into my workflow. Adapted quickly to new concepts and skill sets, reflecting a strong aptitude for continuous learning and professional development.
- Excelled in becoming proficient with unfamiliar technologies, including React, ActiveRecord, and Cypress, in a matter of days. Demonstrated an innate ability to thrive beyond my comfort zone and deliver exceptional results under challenging circumstances.
- Consistently leveraged my strong verbal communication skills to maximise the benefits of pair programming, enabling my pairs to solve complex problems and accelerate learning.
- Applied my rigorous mathematical nature to meticulously testing code across multiple frameworks, including Jest, React Native Testing Library, RSpec, and Cypress. Utilized critical thinking and problem-solving skills to ensure comprehensive test coverage and deliver high-quality, error-free code.
Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill




#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team
