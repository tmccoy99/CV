# Thomas McCoy

As a recent coding bootcamp graduate with a strong academic background in mathematics, I am an enthusiastic and habitual problem solver, constantly seeking to apply my skills to real-world challenges. My discovery of programming in my second year of university was a revelation that ignited my passion for technology and drove me to pursue a career in the field. After graduating with experience of numerical computation and simulation in Python, I completed a rigorous, 12-week web development course at Makers Academy, where I gained valuable experience working in agile teams to develop full-stack web applications.  

My time at Makers Academy solidified my passion for the dynamic and rapidly evolving world of software development. As a motivated individual who thrives on learning and growth, I am excited by the prospect of staying current with the latest advancements and leveraging new knowledge to drive innovation and create value. I look forward to applying my skills and experience to real-world challenges and collaborating with like-minded professionals to deliver results.

My languages and technologies: Javascript, Typescript, Python, Ruby, HTML, CSS, React, Angular, React Native, Jest, Cypress, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Expo, ActiveRecord, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, RSpec, Pandas, SciPy.

## Skills

#### Communication
My master's degree provided extensive research and project experience, which honed my ability to communicate effectively in both written and verbal forms. I am highly proficient in researching academic papers, writing scientific reports using LaTeX, and presenting findings to groups of academics. These experiences have strengthened my communication skills, enabling me to articulate complex ideas with clarity and precision. My advanced comprehension proved invaluable during my time at Makers Academy, where I consistently demonstrated the ability to rapidly grasp new concepts and effectively communicate them to my fellow students. One such instance involved a partner expressing gratitude for my clear explanation of the logic underpinning asynchronous code mocking. I look forward to utilising my strong communication skills in a software team, making valuable contributions to discussions, feedback sessions and agile ceremonies.

In addition to my ability to engage with technical audiences, I am also proficient in simplifying complex concepts for those without a technical background.
I honed this skill during my time as a tennis coach, where parents with little understanding of tennis would expect regular updates on their children's progress and the specifics of what we had been working on. This experience would undoubtedly make me well-suited for a role that involves engaging with stakeholders, as I would be able to convey essential information and updates in a clear, accessible manner tailored to their level of expertise. 



#### Problem Solving
My innate problem-solving ability is what led me to pursue a degree in mathematics, where I developed a methodological approach to solving problems and intense attention to detail. Doing so enabled me to achieve first-class marks in every formative exam throughout my time at university. Drawing on said skills, I can effectively tackle complex technical issues and deliver solutions. For example, during development of my StepFreeGigs mobile app, I overcame a distinct lack of free and relevant APIs by devising a system of sequential API calls to deliver the necessary data, whilst utilising caching to ensure the teamâ€™s API keys were not rate limited. Futhermore, my master's thesis demonstrated my tendency to not simply accept what I work with, but to consistently look to iterate and improve; I concocted a new solution to a certain class of inhomogeneous wave equations under the Fractional Fourier transform, which my professor recognised as an enhancement to the existing literature

#### Continuous Learning
I am a highly motivated and self-directed learner who actively seeks out challenges to expand my knowledge and skills. For example, after discovering my passion for programming at university, I began studying computer science concepts such as data structures and complexity analysis in my spare time. This dedication allowed me to successfully apply these self-taught concepts to various projects, including my programme for [scoring games of bowling](https://github.com/tmccoy99/bowling_challenge_js.git). At Makers, I have a track record of challenging myself with unfamiliar technologies, such as when I pushed our team to develop a mobile app using React Native for the StepFreeGigs project, despite none of us having any experience in this area. Additionally, for the Makersbnb project, I took it upon myself to become proficient in ActiveRecord over a weekend, which enabled our team to quickly set up and efficiently query our database. I am committed to continuous learning and always seek out opportunities to develop my skills.

#### Teamwork
Collaboration and teamwork are essential components of my work ethic, and I thrive in an environment where individuals work together to achieve a common goal. I consistently identify issues in team practices and take the initiative to improve them. For example, in one project, I noticed that code reviews were being made difficult by different formatter settings across our team, as varying string denotations and indentation would often obscure genuine alterations in pull requests. To rectify this, I compiled a set of standardised settings and presented it to the team at our next retrospective, after which all members adopted the settings. This idea helped streamline our code reviews, meaning pull requests were merged more quickly and team members received higher quality feedback. Additionally, my colleagues often express their appreciation for my approachability and helpfulness. During group projects, I am frequently the go-to person for debugging assistance, as my teammates feel comfortable seeking my advice and support. This trust and open communication not only foster a positive work environment but also contribute to our team's overall success.

<!-- #### Another Skill -->
<!-- - Collaborated as a pivotal member of an agile team, contributing to the successful delivery of three key projects within tight timelines. Demonstrated exceptional listening and communication skills during daily stand-ups and retrospectives, ensuring efficient project progress and seamless team coordination.
- Earned positive external feedback for my proficiency in integrating object-oriented programming (OOP) and test-driven development (TDD) methodologies into my workflow. Adapted quickly to new concepts and skill sets, reflecting a strong aptitude for continuous learning and professional development.
- Excelled in becoming proficient with unfamiliar technologies, including React, ActiveRecord, and Cypress, in a matter of days. Demonstrated an innate ability to thrive beyond my comfort zone and deliver exceptional results under challenging circumstances.
- Consistently leveraged my strong verbal communication skills to maximise the benefits of pair programming, enabling my pairs to solve complex problems and accelerate learning.
- Applied my rigorous mathematical nature to meticulously testing code across multiple frameworks, including Jest, React Native Testing Library, RSpec, and Cypress. Utilized critical thinking and problem-solving skills to ensure comprehensive test coverage and deliver high-quality, error-free code.
Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development. -->
